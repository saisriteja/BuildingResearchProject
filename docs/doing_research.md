Rule of thumbs:
1. Never take a paper that doesnot have opensource code, since replicating the results is nearly impossible.
2. For doing more research, you can use the above tools to find more papers and read them. 
3. Build the codebase for the paper and start testing, dont worry too much about the math here untill necessary.
4. When doing a unet training(gan, basic unet or diffusion), please take the smallest dataset and make the model ovefit to the database and check if the model is learning or not. Once you observe the model is learning, then you can move to the bigger dataset. Also in the init stages use a simple models as possible may be one layer and one skip connection is enough, then you can increase the complexity of the model.
5. Logging the results is one of the core compontents of the research, so make sure you log the results properly. Effective logging to be done in xlsheets and then in wandb( preferred) or tensorboard.
6. Pytorch > tensorflow, since pytorch is more flexible and easy to use.
7. For the research, you can use the following tools to generate new ideas and to discuss the paper with AI.


Imp tools I use for my research work
1. Paperpal - brainstorming and writing the paper, also to generate new research ideas.
2. Research Rabbit - multiple similar research papers
3. Consensus - talk with ai about research ps
4. Scispace - chatpdf alternative
5. Rayyan - to manage the papers and to do the systematic review.
6. ChatPDF - to discuss the paper with AI.
7. Mendely -  to store all my research work at one place.
8. Perplexity >> Chatgpt- to generate new research ideas.
